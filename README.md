This is a public repository to help share things like
 our form (based off of J.T.S. Brown) and more information
 to see if this would be helpful ongoing. We'll see. :space_invader:

### Our Form
Our form has its foundation in [J.T.S. Brown](http://wiki.improvresourcecenter.com/index.php/J.T.S._Brown). Over the years we’ve continued to add, modify, and create our own unique way of play. At our heart, we strive for intense group collaboration and discovery, valuing risk over complacency.

We utilize a series of devices to set each other up as a group for success that are executed in a manner that may look ‘formless’.

Any member can be any character at any time. No one member owns a character or scene, the group owns everything together.

The entire space is available to everyone, we are not limited to the stage itself.

Scenes can be as long as an entire show, or as quick as 10 seconds.

*Quick, tell me the main things that differentiate your form from J.T.S. Brown?*
- We have a sideline.
- The possibility for a walk-on is on the table.
- New devices with ability to do a ~25 minute show as well as an hour.

### Show Introduction
The entire group is on stage after our host / booth introduction. There is some light crowd banter where we get a suggestion of a word based off a randomly selected person on one side of the audience’s first letter of their first name. Followed by a word that begins with that letter from anyone in the audience (usually directed at a particular area).

The lights will go down and come back up at which point one person* has remained on stage to begin a character monologue. We strive for unique characters with distinct mannerisms, word phrasing, and point of view. What has happened to this character that is out of the ordinary, what special qualities do they possess, or have experienced? At any point another member will come on stage and “become” the character, morphing and taking over the monologue staying true to the essence of what was brought before it.

We use this character monologue to serve us into our following scenes. We pull relationships, themes, and more from this as well as crafting a character(s) that can be introduced at any time during the show.

### Devices
These can be implemented and executed at any moment, by anyone. Each member has a heightened sense of awareness and understanding that what may seem like curveballs, or instead joyous moments of group discovery and advancement.

These are in alphabetical order.

#### Bre-Rome (Brett + Jerome)
If a teammate is going on a considerable rant, that may be bordering on non-sensical, another teammate (in-scene / off-stage) will put their hand on their shoulder. This will cause the long-winded (and still lovable) teammate to summarize what they were saying in a concise manner.

*Example:*

_Player 1: Ramble, ramble, ramble._

_[ Player 1 is touched on the shoulder lovingly by a teammate ]_

_Player 1: What I’m trying to say is…_

*Bonus example:*

_What everyone else will do to whatever Jerome writes in this document._

#### Crow
A group of off-stage teammates will begin an edit by entering the stage all speaking the same line of dialogue and/or performing the same action (e.g. a group of crows “CAWW”ing and flying across the stage, usually in a very gay way). On-stage teammates will join in and after a flurry of movement, a new group of players will be left on stage to begin a new scene.

#### edTV/Sliding Doors
A teammate will begin a new scene by calling back to an older scene with an exact line of dialogue or action. We will then see a different way the scene could have gone, exploring new choices by the same characters. This edit has a tendency to be overused.

#### Emotional Cloud
An off-stage teammate steps onto corner of stage (unobtrusively), makes the shape of a cloud/word bubble with hands while making whirring sound, states aloud a clear emotion, then shoots the cloud shape into the direction of a character(s) in the current scene. That improviser(s) is now consumed with that emotion.

#### Hemingway
One player will cross the stage giving narrative exposition about the scene on stage (e.g. “Those two boys never did find the missing marble. It haunted Bobby for the rest of his life and he was never comfortable around round objects ever again.) Once the player begins the narration, the scene onstage stops and either clears for a new scene or potentially continues on with the new information.  

When clearing to a new scene, the Hemingway is often used in a multi-part Hemingway. Once the first cross/exposition is finished, another player will begin another cross, with unrelated exposition starting with the last word of the previous exposition. (e.g. “Again, the noise woke Emily from a deep sleep.” “Sleep well, the scroll read, for tomorrow you die.” etc.) The narrations continue until a new group of players has taken the stage and picks up a scene from one of the narrations. Three crosses is pretty typical, but can be any number.

If doing a Hemingway within a scene (to add background or flash forward in time), narrator should be definitive in setting the scene so players know not to leave. 

#### Interrogation
An off-stage teammate will pick a single character in the scene on stage and call them out by saying “_________ , we’d like to ask you a few questions…” All other teammates will leave the stage and become a group of questioners/interrogators leaving only one character on.

#### The Missy
An off-stage teammate comes on stage and gives a member a big giant hug, then returns to off-stage. This drastically changes the mood of the member’s character to be happy.

#### Monty Python
Think the animated bits from Monty Python’s Flying Circus. A teammate will come on stage/break from action and focus on a single object or person. They will then narrate the object or person’s journey through time and space. As we follow it, other teammates will piggyback on this narration as we create a series of events eventually leading us to a brand new scene.

*Example:*

_Player 1: “We follow this golf ball as it lands in the rough…”_

_Player 2: “...where a hawk picks it up and carries it to its nest…”_

_Player 3: “...and it drops it in the mouth of a chick who falls out of the nest and into this scene…”_

#### Shapeshifting (Morphing)
Used especially in our opening and closing (though can be used at anytime), an off-stage teammate will run on stage and position themselves in front of one of the players on stage. The former off-stage teammate will quickly crouch and immediately stand up, signaling to the on-stage player that they are being replaced. The on-stage player will leave and the new player will quickly become the character in the scene, adopting all mannerisms and physical characteristics. They will continue the scene from exactly where it left off.

#### Prism
Off-stage players begin a low hum that starts to build to a crescendo. At its peak, the off-stage players begin to walk across/around the stage. All players, including the players in the scene being edited, begin to talk with heightened emotion as if in their own scene. As these voices starts to fade, a new group of players will find themselves on stage. A new scene will then begin, usually at the height of an emotional moment to keep the energy of the prism carrying through.

#### Shadows
_TODO_

#### Three Questions
An off-stage teammate will run on stage and point to a single character. They will ask them a quick series of questions (e.g. “Are you faking your engagement? Have you told them about the baby?”) that the character will quickly answer. All action on stage will freeze as we learn new information about the scene that is not necessarily revealed to other characters.

The questions should lead to a “Yes”, “No”, or other response from your teammate. The goal is to be precise and let your teammate easily follow and not have to “come up” with anything.

*NOTE:* Does not have to be three questions exactly. We recommend no more than three.

Once a `Boner` always a `Boner`. The ability for current and past members to take the stage together shows the chemistry at work, by putting the time into reherasals and each other.
